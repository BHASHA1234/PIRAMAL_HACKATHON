Introduction
In this competition, the objective is to build a predictive model to determine probabilities associated with loan applications. The dataset comprises primary and secondary train and test data, with some features potentially being time-dependent.

Data Loading and Preprocessing
Data Loading:

Loaded primary training data (train_1.csv) and primary test data (test_1.csv).
Loaded secondary training data (train_2_1.csv, train_2_2.csv) and secondary test data (test_2_1.csv, test_2_2.csv).
Data Merging:

Renamed the columns of secondary datasets to indicate the time period (_t1 for time period 1 and _t2 for time period 2).
Merged the primary data with the corresponding secondary data on the id column using a left join.
Combining Datasets:

Added a dataset column to distinguish between training and test data.
Concatenated the train and test datasets to ensure consistent preprocessing.
Handling Missing Values:

Identified columns with more than 80% missing values and dropped them from the dataset.
Used SimpleImputer to impute missing values:
Numerical columns were imputed using the median strategy.
Categorical columns were imputed using the most frequent strategy.
Feature Engineering
Categorical Encoding:

Identified categorical columns and encoded them using LabelEncoder.
Creating Time-Based Difference Features:

For common columns available in both time periods (_t1 and _t2), calculated the difference between the two periods and created new features with the _diff suffix.
Scaling Features:

Applied StandardScaler to scale numerical features for consistent magnitude.
Clustering:

Used KMeans clustering to create a new feature cluster:
Fitted the KMeans model on the training data (excluding any existing cluster column).
Predicted cluster labels for both training and test data.
Model Training and Evaluation
Data Splitting:

Split the combined dataset back into training and test sets based on the dataset column.
Further split the training data into training and validation sets using train_test_split with stratification on the target variable to maintain class balance.
Models Used:

LightGBM:
Trained a LightGBM model with specified parameters and evaluated using AUC-ROC.
Validation AUC-ROC Score: (Placeholder for actual score)
XGBoost:
Trained an XGBoost model using DMatrix and early stopping.
Validation AUC-ROC Score: (Placeholder for actual score)
CatBoost:
Trained a CatBoost model with early stopping and default depth.
Validation AUC-ROC Score: (Placeholder for actual score)
Model Selection:

Chose the XGBoost model for final predictions based on the highest validation AUC-ROC score.
Prediction and Submission:

Used the trained XGBoost model to predict probabilities on the test data.
Created a submission.csv file containing loan_id and predicted probabilities (prob).
Ensured that the submission file contains the correct number of entries and the required columns.
